### Image Handling

- All images are processed through Sanity CDN
- Recommended formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- Profile images work best as square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Project images work best as landscape (16:9 aspect ratio)

### Ordering

- The **Order** field controls display order in each section
- Lower numbers appear first (0 = first, 1 = second, etc.)
